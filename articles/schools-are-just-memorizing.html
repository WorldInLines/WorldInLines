  <h1>Schools Are Just Memorizing, Not Teaching</h1>
  <p>In most classrooms today, learning is measured by how well students can repeat what they’ve been told. Schools often focus more on memorization than on genuine understanding. Students spend hours preparing for exams, not to explore ideas, but to remember facts that will soon be forgotten.</p>
  <p>Education should be about curiosity, creativity, and critical thinking — not rote learning. When schools value grades over growth, they produce students who know answers but not meanings, who can recall definitions but not apply them in real life.</p>
  <p>To truly educate, schools must change their goal from teaching what to think, to teaching how to think. Only then will learning become more than a race for marks — it will become a lifelong pursuit of wisdom.</p>
